Spring boot app. /company -> gives latest price and volume of that company

1. Thinking of making a file to store company_name: ticker_name [To do fast processing]

3. Organize all the URLs in Application.yaml
If Stock not in Ticker_company file then call https://www.gateway-tt.in/api/search?text=hdfc -> for live price & volume & change

Try New Feature: Thinking of sending auto alerts when change> 10%
